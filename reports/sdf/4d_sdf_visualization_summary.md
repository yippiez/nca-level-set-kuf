# 4D SDF Visualization Summary

## Overview
Successfully trained a Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN) to learn a 4D signed distance function that takes inputs (x, y, z, shape) â†’ distance.

## Model Details
- **Input**: 4D vector [x, y, z, shape_type]
- **Output**: Single distance value
- **Architecture**: 5-layer FCNN with 64 hidden units
- **Training**: 50 epochs on synthetic data from 4 shapes

## Shape Encodings
- s=0: Pill (horizontal capsule)
- s=1: Cylinder
- s=2: Box
- s=3: Torus

## Key Features
1. **Smooth Interpolation**: The model learned to smoothly interpolate between discrete shape types
2. **Cache Integration**: Model saved to cache using the utility functions
3. **Visualization**: Created `sdf_render_4d` function for grid-based visualization

## Generated Visualizations
1. **Default 5x5 Grid**: Shows shapes from s=0 to s=4 with automatic spacing
2. **Specific Values**: Focused visualization on key transition points (s=0.5, s=1.5, etc.)
3. **Detailed Comparison**: High-resolution comparison between s=0 and s=0.5

## Technical Implementation
- Used relative paths with `pathlib` for cross-platform compatibility
- Integrated with existing cache utility for model persistence
- Extended SDF visualization toolkit with 4D capabilities

## Results
The model successfully learned to:
- Represent discrete shapes as continuous functions
- Interpolate between different shape types
- Generate smooth level-set surfaces for arbitrary shape parameters
